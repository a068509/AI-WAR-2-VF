        description="TLDR: This is harder and will make you take a lot of planets.  For advanced players only.

Details: Normally when you capture a planet, all planets adjacent to ANY explored planets become explored.  Unless the map is very narrow, this causes you to get exponentially more planets you can see as the game goes on.  Even further than that, there is a minimum number of planets it will explore for you when you take a planet, depending on the number of planets in your galaxy, so that snake maps and other really narrow maps aren't unplayably hard.

With 'Scout Adjacent Only' enabled, it tosses all that out the window.  Instead it just explores any planets adjacent to the planet you just captured.  This will make snake maps almost impossible to play (so that's a bad combo), but on maps with more cross-connections it can lead to... a certain added strategic challenge.  This still seems masochistic even in the best case, but have fun with that if you want."
