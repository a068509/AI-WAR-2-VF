        description="If there are multiple AI factions, they all hate each other and will fight each other.  They still hate YOU, too, but all this chaos and infighting is assumedly to your benefit.  Then again, you might just find yourself in the crossfire of AIs who are getting more powerful more rapidly due to aggroing each other... so it's anyone's guess as to how long you'll last. This is much harder than a normal game, and is intended more for people who want to watch the AI fight it out with eachother and powerful minor factions."

Note that player-allied factions are all friendly to eachother, so player-allied Marauders and a player-allied AI are friends too."
