We'll also be adding tips in here, over time." />

        full_text="Go through the custom lobby and set things up just the way you want. Start the game, then immediately save (at 0 seconds elapsed).

Now quit the game and find your save file. It will be in ~/AIWar2/PlayerData/Save/Your_campaign_name (assuming you've installed the game in ~/AIWar2; otherwise find where the game is installed). Rename the file from Save_Game_File.save (or whatever name you used to save it) to 'YourQuickStartName.save'

Copy the file into ~/AIWar2/GameData/QuickStarts2/Community

Now you'll want to create a tooltip file so people will know what sort of game they're getting into. The tooltip file is names YourQuickStartName.tooltip.

So at the end of this you have a file called YourQuickStartName.save and YourQuickStartName.tooltip in ~/AIWar2/GameData/QuickStarts2/Community. Now you'll be able to find that quick start under the 'Community' section of the Quick Starts menu

If you have one you really like then upload the save and tooltip to the forums and they might get added to the base game!

Note also that you could make 'Quick Starts' that are some time into a campaign. For example, you might want to see if anyone can survive a bad situation, so you could make a Quick Start called 'Last Stand' where the tooltip tells the player 'I lasted 10 minutes; can you last longer?'
