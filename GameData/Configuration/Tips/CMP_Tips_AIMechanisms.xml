  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_Waves" display_name="Waves" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="On a regular basis, the AI will try to send a 'Wave' of units at you. Each AI planet has a specific set of units it'll try to use, and you are always warned of these attacks a few minutes before they hit (unless you disable Wave Warnings).
		
If you have multiple AIs, each AI will be sending Waves of their own, and do not necessarily need to be on the same target.

Only AI worlds that have an intact Warp Gate can initiate Waves. Destroying particular ones can be helpful in defending certain areas of your territory." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_CPA" display_name="Cross Planet Attack (CPA)" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="After a long period of time (roughly 2 hours for a single AI), a 'Cross Planet Attack' (CPA) will be announced.

The AI will take a large number of the ships guarding its planets and sent them to attack you; these do not create new units. These ships can be from any mark planet, so you might get some very high mark ships headed at you. 

Unlike waves, this isn't against any specific planet.

These can be very large, and are much more dangerous than Waves." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_Reconquest" display_name="Reconquest" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="Once the AIP is high enough, the AI can send 'Reconquest Waves'.
		
These are sent in an identical manner to normal Waves, but are not on a regular basis. Instead, they are only ever sent if it would be strong enough to defeat the defenses on that planet.

Each of these contains a single Usurper unit. If the planet is cleared of hostiles, the Usurper will then be consumed to start reconstructing all of the AIs defenses there, including the Command Station and Warp Gate.

However, if you already paid the AIP for destroying the Station or Warp Gate previously, it won't increase it if you destroy them again." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_WormholeInvasion" display_name="Wormhole Invasion" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="These are only usable on the higher difficulties. When the AIP gets high enough, the AI can send 'Wormhole Invasions'.
		
These are more on a timescale similar to Cross Planet Attacks, but are a little quicker. When one is started, a new Wormhole is opened on one of your planets, usually a backline undefended one.

Several attacks will come out of this new Wormhole, until a while later, it closes and the Invasion ceases." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_Reinforcements" display_name="Reinforcements" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="On a regular basis, the AI will try to 'Reinforce' planets.
		
Essentially what this means is, any AI planet that is currently next to a non-AI one, or has enemies on it, will start to gain more defenses over time. More Turrets will appear, more guards in the Posts, and more Guardians patrolling.

Higher Mark worlds will be much nastier with this, if you let one grow uncontested for a while.

However, you can influence this to some degree. Destroying things such as the Guard Posts will lower the maximum amount of defenses that planet can have, and spreading out your planets can cause the AI to spread the reinforcements out much more in turn.

You can also intentionally leave some planets alone if you don't intend to ever go there, so it starts to drain the Reinforcement Budget from places where it'd be dangerous to you." />
		
  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_Exos" display_name="Exo-Galactic Strikes" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="These are attacks that the AI will only ever use in response to a few specific things.
		
It's something similar to a wave, but doesn't use a specific set of units. It's also from a random nearby AI world, and heads straight for a particular target, ignoring everything else and moving at a higher speed than normal until it arrives.

In general these go for your Homeworld, but the ones generated by Major Data Centers will go for those, and the ones from Risk Analyzers can be either against your Homeworld, or against any Analyzers you currently own." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_CA" display_name="Counter Attacks" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="These are something only triggered when you are taking losses on AI worlds.
		
Essentially, each unit you have lost on a planet is adding to the AIs 'Counter Attack Budget'. Once you have lost enough, a Counter Attack is prepared as the AI spends that budget on units, and a notification appears with a timer.

If you have enough strength on the planet compared to how strong the Counter Attack is, it can be 'stalled', and the timer won't count down. Once the timer hits 0 however, the units in the Counter Attack will appear on that planet, and be free to do whatever they wish, such as attacking your worlds.

Units in the Counter Attack are the same Mark level of the planet that spawned it, so higher Mark worlds generate much scarier Counter Attacks.

However, if every Guard Post on the planet is destroyed, the Counter Attack is completely canceled, and no more can be generated there.

As a last note, if the leader of a Fleet is crippled, they also add to the Counter Attack, particularly things such as Golems." />

  <tip category="AIMechanisms" name="AIMechanisms_Reserves" display_name="Reserves" sort_priority="888"
        full_text="If you have units really far away from any planet you control, 5 hops minimum, there's a chance the AI Reserves will warp in to their location.
		
This is essentially a large AI force that aims to stop whatever sneaky shenanigans you're up to, being that far away from your territory. It gets larger as you move beyond that 5 hop minimum.

If you want to do such 'deepstrike' operations without them interrupting, you'll have to capture the occasional planet farther out, which extends the safe area.

If you hover over planets in the galaxy map and use the full detailed info hotkeys, it'll say if the Reserves can respond there.

Lastly, when the Reserves leave, some of it is left behind and then free to do whatever it wishes, such as attack your worlds." />
