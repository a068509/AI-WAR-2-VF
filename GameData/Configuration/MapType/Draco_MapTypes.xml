		<notes>
			Reads GameData\Configuration\MapType\map.bmp for additional data.
			
			Bitmap data is read in as an array of bytes where Value represents
			density (how likely a planet can be added there) and color represents
			connectivity regions. Planets will only connect up with planets in
			the same region excepting cross-regional boundaries added by MST.
			
			Bitmaps must be saved in 24 bit RGB mode (R8 G8 B8) or the data will
			not be read correctly (inability to use the System.Drawing package)
			and be no bigger than 65536 x 65536 pixels (largely a non-issue) although
			practical maximum size is 600 x 600.
