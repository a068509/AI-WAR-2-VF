  <!--These "InitialPlayerSupportFleet" are completely hand-designed support-stlye fleets that are very inflexible by design.
      They are intended to be basic starting points that you can choose at the start of the game,
      which you can then use to further supplement yourself later on.  Each one is a major archetype,
      focused on a different style of defensive play, and they use both their display name and description in the lobby.
      
      Creating too many of these would be a Bad Thing, because it creates paralysis for players.
      
      Note that ONLY the description and the name are shown, so the description had better be 
      clear enough to let players choose things.  THAT said, the description for each ship type will automatically
      be appended if you use append_each_ship_description_to_main_description="true", so that will help.-->
