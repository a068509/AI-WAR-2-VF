  <!--These fleets are used by battlestations, and chosen completely at random for any given battlestation.
      The weight on them iss how likely they are to show up at all.
      
      The potential_ships lines define a min and max number of types of ships that are subscribed to that category for this fleet.
      Aka "I'll have two types of turrets for sure, but maybe up to five, and I might or might not have an 'OtherDefense' thrown in."
      If there aren't enough of a type of category, like turrets for instance, then it just gives double doses of whatever it is short on.
      So if it only has 4 types of turrets, for example, then it will just add an addition caps' worth to one of them since it doens't have a 5th type to add.
      
      The ships themselves are filled elsewhere by ships saying "I'm in that fleet" versus this file referencing them directly.-->
