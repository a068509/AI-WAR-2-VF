  <!--These command station "fleets" actually define what is available for you on the sidebar to build
      based on which type of command station you have chosen.
      
      Given that we want this to be predictable, it doesn't use potential_ships or randomized ship caps:
      any ships that are subscribed to this fleet design will show up with max cap, 100% of the time.
      
      Essentially these are hand-designed fleets... or another way to think of it is hand-designed ship caps 
      that you can construct from the sidebar.-->

  <!--Ugh... this one is confusing as can be.  It's the Zenith Trader stuff - as you might guess.
      But the tricky part is that it has, in theory, categories and caps and so forth.
      None of that is used at all.  The potential_ships categories, under the hood, never get shown
      for anything that is on the sidebar.  So basically, anything that gets assigned here gets shown at its full cap.
      And then it doesn't really obey caps at all, because the purchases immediately go to the player's planetary fleet
      rather than the zenith fleet.-->

  <!--This is another confusing-ish one.  Basically the "turrets granter" structures give things out of here.
      That could be a turret, or a station-keeper, or whatever else that is okay being direct-placed as part of the
      basic command station fleets.-->
