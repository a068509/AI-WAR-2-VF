  <!--These fleets are used for things that are "mobile fleets" of non-combatants.
      The most basic is just a bunch of combat engineers, which are a type of engineer
      that you don't build from the sidebar, but which rather are built by factories
      like a Bomber or whatever.
      
      Since the potential_ships categories are built around the idea of combat ships,
      we're using the Strike category here even for things that are actually just engineers.
      That's okay, because these categories determine ship caps but are never seen by players.-->
