&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;EXTREMELY HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; This faction expands, and can do irrepairable damage. It is also one of the strongest, capable of steamrolling most enemies due to being able to capture their ships. Even a low Intensity will be dangerous. They will likely dominate any game they appear in, and require specialised strategies to deal with."
