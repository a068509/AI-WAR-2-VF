  <!--The purpose of these build categories is to organize things for the player on the sidebar.
      And by "things," I mean "stuff that you build via direct placement."
      
      Those sorts of things include anything that a Battlestation or a Command Station
      or the Zenith Trader makes available to you at a planet.
      
      Other than how things are organized on the sidebar, this has no effect on anything.
      Repeat: this is purely a visual organization thing on the sidebar 
      for player ships/structures that are directly built.
      
      It has no gameplay, seeding, or other structural significance and doesn't
      affect how the game plays.-->

That said, you can also set up a 'beachhead' of turrets in enemy territory to make their life difficult, so consider bringing Battlestations to the enemy from time to time."
