          description="The easiest (but standard) behavior, causing the Warden Fleet to have to sit by a Warden Fleet Base before it can move to defend a planet. This gives you a much larger window to attack before the Warden shows up to defend, depending on how close the nearest Warden Fleet Base is to the planet you want to attack.  Tip: destroy Warden Fleet Bases to give yourself even more time!"
